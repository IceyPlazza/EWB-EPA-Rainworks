Agenda 9/23/25 

Research Meeting! 


Current issues for CS: 

- Box loses connectivity and no longer transmits data once buried 

 

Todayâ€™s tasks: 

- Make sure everyone can access project files! (BOO ONEDRIVE) 

- Introduce current code 

- GitHub tutorial/run-through 


Research tasks: 

- Find out if we can have an antenna with the Arduino board and if admin allows it. 

- Reseach code to use an antenna for connectivity 

- Research how to read and write files to and from external storage (Likely SD card) 


Secondary tasks: 

- Figure out how to make code more efficient/code cleanup 

- More research on power efficiency or perform calculations/think of logic to better implement deepSleep 


REMINDER: 

Provide ample documentation with your research and code changes! 

You can do that either by creating a new text file documenting your findings/changes, or filling out the descriptions after you commit to GitHub
